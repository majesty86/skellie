# Crud Skellie

*Pulled straight from NUZZLR, here's a nice working CRUD skeleton with all the bells and whistles!*

### Steps

1. Initialize a repo for a new CRUD app, create a README for it.
2. Copy everything but THIS markdown file into it.
3. Already done:
    -User BCrypt methods
    -Session and user controllers(for CRUD)
    -Session helpers
    -NUKE has been added!

4. Happy CRUDding!
